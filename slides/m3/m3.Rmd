# Social Sciences Experiments

## Cause and effect

- Life: daily questions about cause and effect
- Decisions: in part, need cause and effect thinking
- Does eat more vegetables makes you healthier?
- Does donate for a party gives you access to policymaking?
- Do smaller classrooms improve education?
- Do give monetary rewards for parents improve school attendance?
- Can you give an example?

## Cause and effect

- How can we answer to those questions?
- What methods give the right answers?
- What methods do **not** give the right answer?
- We will study these things in this course.

## Cause and effect: example

- Does police violence against protestors increase population support for their cause?
- Maybe firing against protestors will drive them home?
- Evidence: police suppression of black-blocks in Sao Paulo. 
- Maybe it could galvanize their popular support?
- Evidence: 2013 mass protests in Brazil.
- How should the police respond?

## Cause and effect: example

- Medicine: aorthic arrhythmia
- Theory: arrhythmia is a precursor to hearth attack.
- Three drugs developed to stop arrhythmia.
- Guess what?
- Big clinical trial: all drugs failed. Two of them increased the chance of hearth attack.

## Cause and effect: example

- Medicine: aorthic arrhythmia
- All the theory supported the claim that arrthymia caused heart attacks
- But by correlations!
- Correlation: many people with arrthymia have hearth attack
- Does it make it a cause of hearth attack?

## Cause and effect: example

- Does take a prep-course increase your scores?
- Many would think it is true.
- But what about the fact that many people taking a prep-test are motivated to get best scores?
- Mayor in the US: every time our team wins, we party.
- Would you prescribe partying as a way for your team to win?

## Cause and effect

- Although this sounds ridiculous, that what we do in most of our research...
- We usually say to people: in order to pass the exam, you have to take the prep test.
- However, what are the *unobserved* factors affecting this prescription?
- *Unobserved*: things that we cannot measure: motivation, willingness to work hard, family support, etc
- Most of the research carried out claims that *we just need to control for X*

## Cause and effect

- I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but there are things we cannot control for!
- How many people said to you past year: 
  - You just need to control for $X$? 
  - Your measures will improve if you look at $Y$ as a source of heterogeneity?
  - Why don't you split your sample in $Z$?
- There is, and there will always be, unobservable characteristics when doing observational research.

## Cause and effect

- Is there a way out of this mess?
- What if you could be sure to say: I don't need to do that because my dataset is credibly not affected by this variable?
\pause- Good news: **experiments**!

## Experiments

- Experiments: assign units to treatment or control.
- Treatment: get the intervention.
- Control: gets nothing.
- But how do we decide who gets what?
- One way: alternating.
- Fibiger: tested treatment of Diphthria studying people day-on-day-off in a hospital.
- Clever... but what is the problem?

## Experiments

- Fisher: first person who saw this problem.
- What is the way to assign units to treatment and control in order to eliminate any systematic differences between them?
- His answer: random assignment!

## Experiments

- But why random assignment?
- Physics: does not need random assignment.
- Atoms: more or less the same.
- This means that they are *interchangeable*
- But is it possible to do experiments in social sciences?

## Experiments

- The answer is: in most of the cases, yes!
- Why we don't do more then?
- Because it is very hard to mimic real-life situations.

## Experiments

- Example: we could show a jar for a person.
- Say that there is a ball, either red or blue.
- Then show up in the screen: *a credible source says that the ball has 70\% chance to be red*.
- Finally, the person has to guess the color of the ball.
- What is this experiment testing?

## Experiments

- This experiment is great, and in some sense, has the power that it isolates the key characteristics of political information.
- However, is there any other setting that could give a *more naturalistic* approach?
- That's what we do in **field experiments**.
- The name came from actual agricultural experiments.
- **Realism**: objetive of field exps. Although hard to achieve.

## Experiments: realism

- Degree if realism:
  - Authenticity of the treatment
  - Participants
  - Contexts
  - Outcomes
- But what constitutes a field experiment depends on how the *field* is defined.

## Field Experiments

- Field experiments: challenging to implement.
- Require:
  - Design
  - Planning
  - Pilot testing
  - Constant supervision
- Another criticism: fail to grasp big questions.
- But the field is increasing fast.

## Naturally ocurring experiments

- Quasi-experiments: experiments naturally occuring or assigned by governments or institutions.
  - Vienam draft lottery.
  - Random audit in Brazilian municipalities.
  - Scheduled castes for Indian local government.
  - Size of legislature determined by population thresholds.
- But they do not envolve explicit random assignment.

# Causal Inference and Experimentation

## Potential Outcomes

- Experiments makes things easier in terms of analysis.
- But there are some technicalities that we need to learn.
- For instance, many problems happened in the field.
- E.g., in my Zika experiment, the App crashed in the day that I went in the field. What to do?
- To decide, you have to understand what can be done to solve, without violating the randomness.

## Potential Outcomes

- Suppose we have an experiment to access the impact health care provision
- Suppose we have the following question: do health care interventions to decrease dengue work?
- The context is Dengue prevention.
- Teams have to go to households, finding and eliminating breeding sites of *a. aegypti*.
- And we assign streets to either to teams or not.

## Potential Outcomes: definitions

- **Treatment**: receiving or not a team.
- **Outcome**: dengue fever cases in each street block.

## Potential Outcomes: definitions

- Let a given street block $i$.
- For each street block, we have the outcomes in terms of dengue, having the treatment assigned or not.
- And here are the outcomes:

## Potential Outcomes

```{r, echo=FALSE}
dt <- data.frame(
  Street = c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7, 'Average'),
  Yi_0 = c(15,15,30,15,20,15,30, 20),
  Yi_1 = c(10,15,20,20,10,15,15, 15),
  tau_i = c(-5,0,-10,5,-10,0,-15, -5))
kable(dt, "latex", booktabs = T, align = "c") %>%
  kable_styling(position = "center") %>%
  column_spec(1, bold=T) %>%
  column_spec(4, bold=T) %>%
  row_spec(0, bold=T) %>%
  row_spec(8, bold=T)
```

- $Y_i(0)$: outcome when the unit is **not** treated
- $Y_i(1)$: outcome when the unit is treated
- And for example, unit $i=3$ has an effect of $-10$.

## Potential Outcomes

```{r, echo=FALSE}
dt <- data.frame(
  Street = c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7, 'Average'),
  Yi_0 = c(15,15,30,15,20,15,30, 20),
  Yi_1 = c(10,15,20,20,10,15,15, 15),
  tau_i = c(-5,0,-10,5,-10,0,-15, -5))
kable(dt, "latex", booktabs = T, align = "c") %>%
  kable_styling(position = "center") %>%
  column_spec(1, bold=T) %>%
  column_spec(4, bold=T) %>%
  row_spec(0, bold=T) %>%
  row_spec(8, bold=T)
```

- Treatment effects:
$$ \tau_i \equiv Y_i(1) - Y_i(0) $$

## Potential Outcomes

```{r, echo=FALSE}
dt <- data.frame(
  Street = c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7, 'Average'),
  Yi_0 = c(15,15,30,15,20,15,30, 20),
  Yi_1 = c(10,15,20,20,10,15,15, 15),
  tau_i = c(-5,0,-10,5,-10,0,-15, -5))
kable(dt, "latex", booktabs = T, align = "c") %>%
  kable_styling(position = "center") %>%
  column_spec(1, bold=T) %>%
  column_spec(4, bold=T) %>%
  row_spec(0, bold=T) %>%
  row_spec(8, bold=T)
```

- What is the problem here?

## Potential Outcomes

```{r, echo=FALSE}
dt <- data.frame(
  Street = c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7, 'Average'),
  Yi_0 = c(15,15,30,15,20,15,30, 20),
  Yi_1 = c(10,15,20,20,10,15,15, 15),
  tau_i = c(-5,0,-10,5,-10,0,-15, -5))
kable(dt, "latex", booktabs = T, align = "c") %>%
  kable_styling(position = "center") %>%
  column_spec(1, bold=T) %>%
  column_spec(4, bold=T) %>%
  row_spec(0, bold=T) %>%
  row_spec(8, bold=T)
```

- What is the problem here?

## Potential Outcomes

- Suppose that we assign the treatment $d_{i}$ to the street blocks.
- $d_{i} \in \{0,1\}$
- Then, we will observe $Y_{i}(d_{i})$ for every unit $i$.
- The observed outcome is equal to
$$ Y_{i} \ = \ d_{i} Y_{i}(1) - (1-d_{i})Y_{i}(0) $$
- It is the combination of the two possibilities.

## Potential Outcomes

- And the average treatment effect (ATE) is the average of all $\tau_i$.
$$ ATE \ = \ \dfrac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N} \tau_{i} $$
- Now suppose that we draw two street blocks randomly. How many possible selections we have?
$$ {N \choose k} = {7 \choose 2} = 21 $$
- We could now compute the average for any of the random draws:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
options(width=50)
(dt$Yi_0[combn(7,2)[1,]]+dt$Yi_0[combn(7,2)[2,]])/2
```

## Potential Outcomes

- And the average is equal to 20.
- We will look into the average treatment effect.
- This represents the average differences in control and treatment:
\begin{eqnarray*} 
E[Y_{i}(1) - Y_{i}(0)] & = & E[Y_{i}(1)] - E[Y_{i}(0)] \\
& = & \dfrac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N} Y_{i}(1) - \dfrac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N} Y_{i}(0) \\
& = & \dfrac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N} [Y_{i}(1) - Y_{i}(0)] \\
& = & \dfrac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N} [\tau_{i}] \\
& = & ATE \\
\end{eqnarray*}

## Some statistics properties

Mean:

- Mean of sum is sum of means:
$$ E(X + Y) = E(X)+E(Y) $$
- Mean times scalar, scalar goes out:
$$ E(\alpha X) = \alpha E(X) $$
- Mean plus scalar, scalar sums up mean:
$$ E(\alpha X + \beta) = \alpha E(X)+\beta $$
- Mean:
$$ E(X) = \sum_{x \in X} x Pr[X=x] $$


## Some statistics properties: Conditional Expectation

- Conditional expectation: expected values of a variable conditioning on values of another variable.

$$ E[Y | X = x] = \sum y Pr[Y=y | X = x] $$

- Compute $E[\tau_{i} | Y_{i}(0) > 10]$:
$$ E[\tau_{i} | Y_{i}(0) > 10] = \sum \tau \dfrac{Pr[\tau_{i}, \  Y_{i}(0)>10]}{Pr[Y_{i}(0)>10]} $$

## Statistics and experiments

- Suppose that we want to select five streets to receive the treatment and two for the control
- ${7 \choose 5}$?
- And we have $\dfrac{5}{7}$ chance of assign an unit to treatment.
- How does this look like?

## Statistics and experiments

- Causal inference is a missing data problem!

```{r, echo=FALSE}
dt2 <- data.frame(
  Street = c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7, 'Average'),
  Yi_0 = c(15,'?','?','?','?','?',30, 22.5),
  Yi_1 = c('?',15,20,20,10,15,'?', 16),
  tau_i = c('?','?','?','?','?','?','?', -6.5))
kable(dt2, "latex", booktabs = T, align = "c") %>%
  kable_styling(position = "center") %>%
  column_spec(1, bold=T) %>%
  column_spec(4, bold=T) %>%
  row_spec(0, bold=T) %>%
  row_spec(8, bold=T)
```

## Statistics and experiments

- The real effects, in case you could perfectly observe, is (red = treatment):

```{r, echo=FALSE}
dt3 <- data.frame(
  Street = c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7),
  Yi_0 = c(15,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,30),
  Yi_1 = c(NA,15,20,20,10,15,NA),
  tau_i = c(NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA))
fig1 <- ggplot(dt[-c(8),], aes(x = Street, y = Yi_0)) + 
  geom_point(colour="black") +
  geom_point(aes(x=Street, y=Yi_1), colour="red") +
  ylim(0,40) + ylab('Outcomes')
fig1
```

## Statistics and experiments

- But you observe this (red = treatment):

```{r, echo=FALSE}
dt3 <- data.frame(
  Street = c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7),
  Yi_0 = c(15,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,30),
  Yi_1 = c(NA,15,20,20,10,15,NA),
  tau_i = c(NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA))
fig2 <- ggplot(dt3, aes(x = Street, y = Yi_0)) + 
  geom_point(colour="black") +
  geom_point(aes(x=Street, y=Yi_1), colour="red") +
  ylim(0,40) + ylab('Outcomes')
fig2
```

## Statistics and experiments

- And side by side (red = treatment):

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggarrange(fig1, fig2, ncol = 2, nrow = 1)
```

## Random assignment

- Why the random assignment work?
- Let $Y_{i}(1)$ an unit $i$ outcome in the treatment.
- $Y_{i}(0)$ an unit $i$ outcome in the control.
- $D_{i} = 1$ the assignment for treatment.
- $D_{i} = 0$ the assignment for the control.

## Random assignment

- Then, as the treatment is assigned randomly, we say that is orthogonal to the outcomes and any confounder.

- In math:

$$ Y_{i}(0),Y_{i}(1),X \perp D_{i} $$

- And as a consequence:

$$ E[Y_{i}(1)|D_{i} = 1] = E[Y_{i}(1)] = E[Y_{i}(1)|D_{i} = 0] $$

$$ E[Y_{i}(0)|D_{i} = 0] = E[Y_{i}(0)] = E[Y_{i}(0)|D_{i} = 0] $$

- Thus:

$$ ATE = E[Y_{i}(1)|D_{i} = 1] - E[Y_{i}(0)|D_{i} = 0] $$

## Random assignment

- **Estimators**: what we use to find (estimate) the parameter of interest.

- Properties:

![Efficiency and unbiasedness.](../imgs/effunb.png)

- How to estimate the ATE in an unbiased way?

- If $\hat{\theta}$ is an estimator of $\theta$, then unbiasedness mean $E[\hat{\theta}] = \theta$.

## Random assignment

- Suppose we assign the treatment to $m$ streets and the control to $N-m$ streets. Then:

\begin{eqnarray*}
E\left(\dfrac{\sum_{1}^{m}Y_{i}}{m} - \dfrac{\sum_{i=m+1}^{N-m}Y_{i}}{N-m}\right) & = & E\left(\dfrac{\sum_{1}^{m} Y_{i}}{m}\right) - E\left(\dfrac{\sum_{i=m+1}^{N-m}Y_{i}}{N-m}\right) \\
& = & E[Y_{i}(1) | D_{i} = 1] - E[Y_{i}(0) | D_{i} = 0] \\
& = & E[Y_{i}(1) - Y_{i}(0)] = E[ \tau_{i} ] = ATE
\end{eqnarray*}

- This estimator is unbiased! It is called the *differences-in-means* estimator.

## Random assignment

- But this still does not define what a random assignment is.
- What is random assignment?
- **Definition**: An assignment that is statistically independent to all *observed* and *unobserved* variables.
- **Complete random assignment**: first design we will use.
  - When we randomly design $m$ units for the treatment and $N-m$ units for the control.
  - Like throw a fair coin to assign cases to treatment and control.
- We will use a tool called *DeclareDesign*. It is probably the best there is on experimental implementation, analysis and diagnostics.

## Random assignment

- What happens when we don't use random assignment?
- Selection bias:

$$
E[Y_{i}(1)|D_{i} = 1] - E[Y_{i}(0)|D_{i} = 0] = 
$$

$$
E[Y_{i}(1) - Y_{i}(0) | D_{i} = 1] + E[Y_{i}(0) | D_{i} = 1] - E[Y_{i}(0) | D_{i} = 1]
$$

- Note that $E[Y_{i}(0) | D_{i} = 1] - E[Y_{i}(0) | D_{i} = 0]$ should be zero when the assignment is random!
- Real-life example: Instead of random assignment, we left households to decide whether they will receive a given team or another.
- And the households with more Dengue get better teams.

## Random assignment: core assumptions

- Potential outcomes:
  - Each street have a dengue level when treated and not treated
  - The potential outcomes, to work, require that each potential outcome depend *solely* on whether they *itself* received the treatment.
  - *solely*: excludability assumption
  - *itself*: non-interference

## Random assignment: excludability

- Potential outcomes:
  - Only two, and the only relevant causal agent is the treatment assignment.
  - We must distinguish between *treatment* ($d_{i}$) and other variables that relate with the treatment ($z_{i}$).
  - Example: $Y_{i}(z,d)$::
    - $Y_{i}(z=1,d=1)$: get the drug and take the drug
    - $Y_{i}(z=1,d=0)$: get the drug but throw it in the garbage
    - $Y_{i}(z=0,d=1)$: wasn't supposed to get the drug, but found it in the garbage and took it
    - $Y_{i}(z=0,d=0)$: didn't get the drug and didn't take it

**Excludability:** $$Y_{i}(z=1,d) = Y_{i}(z=0,d)$$

## Threats to excludability?

- Don't take the drug.
- Don't have good measurements in a street compared to another.
- Fail to deliver the treatment (partial implementation)
- Some people refusing or claiming the treatment.
- Medical studies: double blind because of such problems...

## Random assignment: non-interference

- SUTVA: Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption
- $Y_{i}(d)$: written as the value of the unit only depends on the treatment itself.
- So, regardless of what was the treatment status of other units, the treatment effect depends only on the assignment to the given unit.
- For example: what if the unit get treated because we treated all neighbor street? Interference!
- If streets are far away from each other, then ok!
- We will study spillover in the next chapters.

# Summary

## Summary

- **Random assignment**: treatment allocated such that all units have a known probability.
  - Treatment assignment unpredictable

- **Excludability**: Potential outcomes depend only in the treatment.

- **Non-interference**: Reflect only treatment and control for the unit, and not for others.

- Next class: doing random assignments!
